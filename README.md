# Microsoft-Engage-submission
Video calling chat application using Django and Agora Video SDK for real time communication deployed on heroku. It has a small functional person-to-person messenger using REST API and WebSockets for a person to chat with other users during the video call. I have used pusher presence channels to show which clients are online and iframes for integration. I have used Vue.JS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for frontend.
